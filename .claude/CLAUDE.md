# CLAUDE.md - Project Instructions

## Project

<!-- Brief description of the project. Replace this placeholder. -->

A Claude-first Python project template. See @README.md for full documentation.

## IMPORTANT: Verify What You Change

**Code is not "done" until you've run it and seen it work.**

Use your judgment. If you changed it, verify it:

- Changed code? → `make ci` (runs lint, format, typecheck, tests)
- Changed a workflow? → Push and check the workflow output
- Added a pre-commit hook? → `pre-commit run --all-files`
- Changed Docker? → `docker compose build`
- Changed the CLI? → Run the CLI command you changed

Don't just run tests. Tests can pass while the code is broken.

## Commands

```bash
make install-dev  # Install with dev deps
make ci           # Full CI: lint, format-check, typecheck, test with coverage
make verify       # Full verification: imports, tests, smoke tests, CLI
make lint         # Just linting
make test         # Just tests
make docker-build # Build Docker image
```

Run `make help` to see all available commands.

## Cost Optimization

**Every API call costs money. Be efficient.**

1. **Monitor context usage** - Keep under 40% (80K/200K tokens) when possible
   - Check regularly with token counter
   - Summarize, compact & commit work to reset context
   - Use offset/limit when reading large files

2. **Add learnings with references** - Document fixes with file:line references
   - Example: `src/module/file.py:42`
   - Update CLAUDE.md or relevant docs with specific locations

3. **Prefer command line tools** to reduce context
   - Use `jq` for JSON, `grep` for search, `git` for history
   - Avoid reading entire files when possible
   - Never launch interactive CLI tools (use `--no-interactive`, etc.)
   - Prefer language server plugins over grep for go-to-definition, find-references

4. **Fix style issues at the end** - Ignore line length and type errors until done, then use `make ci`

## Python Type Annotations

Use modern style (Python 3.10+):

```python
# ✅ CORRECT - use built-in types and | None
def process(items: list[str], config: dict[str, int] | None = None) -> tuple[str, int]:
    ...

# ❌ WRONG - old style typing imports
from typing import Dict, List, Optional
def process(items: List[str], config: Optional[Dict[str, int]] = None) -> Tuple[str, int]:
    ...
```

**Rules:**
- Use `list`, `dict`, `tuple`, `set` directly (not from `typing`)
- Use `X | None` instead of `Optional[X]`
- Use `X | Y` instead of `Union[X, Y]`

## Think Holistically

Before diving into code:
- What is the **PURPOSE** of this tool?
- Why is it failing on this issue?
- Is this a symptom of a **larger architectural problem**?
- Take a step back and analyze the **root cause**

Don't just fix symptoms. Understand the underlying architecture first.

## Development Best Practices

- **Commit often** - Small, focused commits are easier to review and rollback
- **Use `git add -p`** - Interactive staging to add only relevant changes
- **Use TDD** - Write tests first when possible
- **Keep it simple** - Evaluate alternatives before complex solutions
- **Measure twice, cut once** - Plan before implementing

## Using Subagents

Use subagents to reduce context usage and parallelize work:

**Research Subagent (Sonnet)**
- Search the repo, web research, gathering context
- Report back with file paths, line numbers, and relevant excerpts

**Implementation Subagent (Haiku)**
- Execute small, well-defined chunks of work
- Complete one task, report back for review before continuing

**Pattern:**
1. Research subagent gathers context and reports findings
2. Main agent reviews and plans implementation steps
3. Implementation subagent executes one step at a time
4. Main agent reviews each step before proceeding

## Command Line Shortcuts

```bash
# Quick file inspection with git
git ls-files | wc -l              # Count files
git ls-files | grep "*.sql"       # Find files by pattern
git log --oneline -10             # Recent changes

# JSON inspection with jq
cat file.json | jq .key           # Parse field
cat file.json | jq .              # Pretty print
```

## Learnings

*(Add items here as you discover them)*

- Clear settings cache between tests: `get_settings.cache_clear()`
- Use `tmp_path` fixture for temporary test files
- Always run `make ci` before committing - catches lint/format/type issues
- After pushing workflow changes, check Actions tab for actual results
